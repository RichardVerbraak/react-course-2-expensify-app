//# Different way of adding property onto object

Refers to beforeEach test function we have in expenses.test.js
expensesData is an object. You can add properties to an object in two ways:

1.

expensesData.someProperty = { description, note, amount, createdAt }
2.

expensesData['someProperty']= { description, note, amount, createdAt }
The reason we use the second version is because the first version only works with pre-defined strings. What if "someProperty" is a dynamic variable or something not a string? Then the first version won't work in that case.


//# REDUX-THUNK 

With redux-thunk. Redux calls the function we return and passes in dispatch as an argument. When we call dispatch in the function, it then dispatches that action.
